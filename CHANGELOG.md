## [Unreleased] — branch `refactor/consolidate`

### Fixed (project configuration)
- **`NQueen.ConsoleApp.csproj`** — changed `TargetFramework` from `net10.0-windows` to
  `net10.0`; the Console project has no Windows-specific dependencies (no WPF, no WinForms,
  no P/Invoke), so the `-windows` suffix was unnecessary and restricted portability.

### Removed (NQueen.Benchmarking dead template artefacts)
- **`Properties\Resources.resx`** and **`Properties\Resources.Designer.cs`** — deleted;
  these were left over from the project template and are never referenced by any benchmark.
- **`NQueen.Benchmarking.csproj`** — removed the dead `<EmbeddedResource>` entry that
  pointed to the now-deleted `Resources.resx`.

### Removed (NQueen.Benchmarking dead code)
- **`Usings.cs`** — removed dead `global using NQueen.Kernel;`; the root namespace has no
  public types after `BitboardNQueenSolver` moved to `NQueen.Kernel.Solvers`.
- **`AllCountOnlyN18Benchmark.cs`**, **`CountUniqueFastHalfBoardBenchmark.cs`**,
  **`CountUniqueHalfBoardBenchmarks.cs`** — removed three identical copy-pasted private
  `NoopFormatter` nested classes, replaced by a single shared top-level class.

### Added (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **`NoopFormatter.cs`** — new shared `internal sealed class NoopFormatter` consolidating
  the three previously duplicated nested formatters.
- **`NQueenBench.cs`** — extracted `NQueenBench` benchmark class out of `Program.cs` into
  its own file; each benchmark class now lives in its own file.

### Fixed (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **`Program.cs`** — removed `NQueenBench` class (moved to `NQueenBench.cs`); fixed
  corrupted `…` ellipsis character in the startup console message.
- **`UniqueSolutionCounterPackedBenchmark.cs`** — added `using var` to `BitmaskSolver`
  for consistent deterministic disposal, matching every other benchmark.
- **`SymmetryHelperCanonicalKeyBenchmark.cs`** — changed `int[]?` fields to `int[] = null!`
  and removed the unreachable null-guard inside `[Benchmark]` (`[GlobalSetup]` always runs
  before `[Benchmark]` in BenchmarkDotNet).
- **`CombinedSolverBenchmarks.cs`** — reduced `AllModeVariantsBenchmark` parameter space
  from 144 combinations (3×3×2×2×4) to 32 (2×2×2×4) by collapsing the two independent
  pruning booleans into a single `EnablePruning` flag and trimming the size/depth ranges to
  the two most representative values each.

### Removed (NQueen.Console dead code)
- **`CommandConstants.cs`** — entire file deleted; every constant was only referenced from
  `CommandProcessor` or `HelpCommands`, both of which are also removed.
- **`ConsoleUtils.cs`** — entire file deleted; `WriteLineColored` was only called from
  the dead `HelpCommands` class.
- **`HelpCommands.cs`** — entire file deleted; all members (`ShowHelp`, `ShowExitError`,
  `DumpAllHelp`, `DumpHelpText`, `Valid_Commands`, `Command_Example`, `NQueen_Help_Board_Size`,
  `NQueen_Solution_Mode`, `NQUEEN_BOARDSIZE`, `Bitmask_Help`, `Banner`) had zero live call sites.
- **`ICommandProcessor.cs`** — interface deleted; never resolved from DI at runtime.
- **`CommandProcessor.cs`** — class deleted; all three methods were deprecation-message stubs
  with no live callers.
- **`DispatchUtils.cs`** — entire file deleted; `ParseInput`, `CreateChessBoard`, and
  `LaunchConsoleMonitor` all had zero call sites.
- **`DispatchCommands`** — removed dead `RegexSpaces()`, `genRegEx()`, and `_whiteSpacesRegex`;
  `partial` modifier removed now that no source-generated partial members remain.
- **`App.cs`** — removed dead `DispatchCommands dispatchCommands` constructor parameter and the
  `_dispatchCommands` field; `RunInteractiveMenu` is `static` so the instance was never used.
- **`Program.cs`** — removed stale dotnet-counters installation comment and dead DI
  registrations for `DispatchCommands` (transient) and `ICommandProcessor`/`CommandProcessor`.
- **`Using.cs`** — removed three dead global usings: `NQueen.ConsoleApp.Interfaces`,
  `System.Diagnostics`, `System.Text.RegularExpressions`.

### Renamed
- **`DispachCommands.cs` → `DispatchCommands.cs`** — corrected long-standing filename typo
  (missing `t`). Class name was already correct; only the filename was misspelled.

### Fixed (accessibility)
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — added `AutomationProperties.Name="Chessboard"` to the
  outer `Border` to satisfy the *NameNotNull* rule (Accessibility Checker error at line 16).
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — bound `Width` and `Height` from `SquareViewModel` and
  added `AutomationProperties.Name="{Binding}"` to each DataTemplate `Border`, giving every
  chess square a concrete bounding rectangle and resolving the *BoundingRectangleNotNull* rule
  (Accessibility Checker error at line 36).
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml.cs`** — removed the now-resolved TODO comment block that
  tracked both accessibility errors.

### Removed (dead code)
- **`SimulationSettings`** — deleted 7 unused members:
  `ParallelAllAutoEnableThresholdN`, `LargeBoardProgressThrottleThreshold`,
  `DynamicRootSplitLimitN`, `AdaptiveRootMultiplier`, `RootBranchThreshold`,
  `WeightLookaheadDepth`, `CalculateSplitDepth`.
- **`BoardSettings`** — deleted 6 unused constants:
  `RelativeFactor`, `ExtraSmallSizeForUniqueMode`, `SmallSizeForUniqueMode`,
  `MediumSizeForUniqueMode`, `RelativeLargeSizeForUniqueMode`, `DefaultQueenImagePath`.
- **`MainViewModel.Properties.cs`** — removed unreachable private method `UpdateProgress(double, string)`.
- **`MainViewModel.Properties.cs`** — removed no-op `OnIsSingleRunningChanged` partial callback
  (the CommunityToolkit source generator already fires `PropertyChanged` automatically).
- **`LazyPositionList.cs`** — removed stale TODO comment; the class is already in use.
- **`HelpCommands.cs`** — removed dead `ProcessHelpCommand` method (zero call sites) and its
  two associated TODO comments; also removed orphaned `case` blocks left by the method removal.
- **`DispatchUtils.cs`** — removed two stale TODO comments (`"Change the order of indices"` and
  `"Find a better data structu"`) — the board rendering and variable naming are both correct.
- **`InputViewModel.cs`** — removed stale bug TODO; the described chessboard-reset issue is
  already resolved by `UpdateUiState()` calling `ChessboardVm?.CreateSquares(boardSize)` before
  every simulation.
- **`UiMessages.cs`** — removed stale TODO to move constants; the referenced constants are
  already present in `CommandConst`.

### Clarified
- **`ISolverBackEnd`** — replaced stale "moved from ISolver" inline comment with a clear
  description of `UseCountOnlyAllMode`/`UseCountOnlyUniqueMode` and their relationship to
  the solver's `ResultStorageMode` properties.

### Refactored
- **`BitboardNQueenSolver` relocated** — moved from `NQueen.Kernel/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel`) to `NQueen.Kernel/Solvers/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel.Solvers`), co-locating it with `BitmaskSolver` and all other
  solver infrastructure. No call-site changes required; the existing
  `global using NQueen.Kernel.Solvers;` in `NQueen.Kernel/Usings.cs` already covers all callers.
- **`ISolverFrontEnd` TODO removed** — deleted the stale five-line TODO comment block from
  `NQueen.Domain/Interfaces/ISolverFrontEnd.cs`. The described work (migrate event-arg types
  to `Memory<int>` and add a `Guid`-bearing progress event) had already been fully implemented
  in `QueenPlacedEventArgs`, `SolutionFoundEventArgs`, and `ProgressUpdateEventArgs`.

### Verified
- Build: ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: ✅ 304/304 passing
