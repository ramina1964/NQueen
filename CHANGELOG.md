## [Unreleased] — branch `refactor/consolidate`

### Fixed (accessibility)
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — added `AutomationProperties.Name="Chessboard"` to the
  outer `Border` to satisfy the *NameNotNull* rule (Accessibility Checker error at line 16).
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — bound `Width` and `Height` from `SquareViewModel` and
  added `AutomationProperties.Name="{Binding}"` to each DataTemplate `Border`, giving every
  chess square a concrete bounding rectangle and resolving the *BoundingRectangleNotNull* rule
  (Accessibility Checker error at line 36).
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml.cs`** — removed the now-resolved TODO comment block that
  tracked both accessibility errors.

### Removed (dead code)
- **`SimulationSettings`** — deleted 7 unused members:
  `ParallelAllAutoEnableThresholdN`, `LargeBoardProgressThrottleThreshold`,
  `DynamicRootSplitLimitN`, `AdaptiveRootMultiplier`, `RootBranchThreshold`,
  `WeightLookaheadDepth`, `CalculateSplitDepth`.
- **`BoardSettings`** — deleted 6 unused constants:
  `RelativeFactor`, `ExtraSmallSizeForUniqueMode`, `SmallSizeForUniqueMode`,
  `MediumSizeForUniqueMode`, `RelativeLargeSizeForUniqueMode`, `DefaultQueenImagePath`.
- **`MainViewModel.Properties.cs`** — removed unreachable private method `UpdateProgress(double, string)`.
- **`MainViewModel.Properties.cs`** — removed no-op `OnIsSingleRunningChanged` partial callback
  (the CommunityToolkit source generator already fires `PropertyChanged` automatically).
- **`LazyPositionList.cs`** — removed stale TODO comment; the class is already in use.
- **`HelpCommands.cs`** — removed dead `ProcessHelpCommand` method (zero call sites) and its
  two associated TODO comments; also removed orphaned `case` blocks left by the method removal.
- **`DispatchUtils.cs`** — removed two stale TODO comments (`"Change the order of indices"` and
  `"Find a better data structu"`) — the board rendering and variable naming are both correct.
- **`InputViewModel.cs`** — removed stale bug TODO; the described chessboard-reset issue is
  already resolved by `UpdateUiState()` calling `ChessboardVm?.CreateSquares(boardSize)` before
  every simulation.
- **`UiMessages.cs`** — removed stale TODO to move constants; the referenced constants are
  already present in `CommandConst`.

### Clarified
- **`ISolverBackEnd`** — replaced stale "moved from ISolver" inline comment with a clear
  description of `UseCountOnlyAllMode`/`UseCountOnlyUniqueMode` and their relationship to
  the solver's `ResultStorageMode` properties.

### Refactored
- **`BitboardNQueenSolver` relocated** — moved from `NQueen.Kernel/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel`) to `NQueen.Kernel/Solvers/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel.Solvers`), co-locating it with `BitmaskSolver` and all other
  solver infrastructure. No call-site changes required; the existing
  `global using NQueen.Kernel.Solvers;` in `NQueen.Kernel/Usings.cs` already covers all callers.
- **`ISolverFrontEnd` TODO removed** — deleted the stale five-line TODO comment block from
  `NQueen.Domain/Interfaces/ISolverFrontEnd.cs`. The described work (migrate event-arg types
  to `Memory<int>` and add a `Guid`-bearing progress event) had already been fully implemented
  in `QueenPlacedEventArgs`, `SolutionFoundEventArgs`, and `ProgressUpdateEventArgs`.

### Verified
- Build: ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: ✅ 304/304 passing
