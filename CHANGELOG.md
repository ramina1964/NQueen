## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (NQueen.GUI)
- **`ListOfSolutionsUserControl.xaml` / `MainWindow.xaml`** — the solution-list frame no
  longer "jumps" from a collapsed height to its full height as the first ~5 results arrive.
  The grouping `Border` previously sized to its content (with the inner `ListBox` capped at
  `MaxHeight="130"`); it now stretches (`VerticalAlignment="Stretch"`) to fill the
  board-height area the control is already allocated, and the `ListBox` fills that fixed
  frame, so the height is stable from the first result. Spacing was moved inside the frame
  (Border `Padding` token = 4, outer `Margin="0"`). The list also hugs its content width
  (`HorizontalAlignment="Left"`, `MaxHeight` and `MinWidth` removed) and the left grid
  column is now `Width="Auto"`, so it no longer reserves surplus horizontal space. The
  `Border` and `ListBox` widths are
  now capped (`MaxWidth`) to a hidden sizer `TextBlock` measuring the widest item
  (`Solution No. 00`) in the selected-item weight (Bold), so the frame is exactly as wide as
  the solution name — font/DPI-robust, with no hard-coded pixel width.

### Changed (NQueen.GUI)
- **`MainWindow.xaml` / `MainWindow.xaml.cs`** — the main window is now user-resizable.
  The root layout is wrapped in a `Viewbox` (`Stretch="Uniform"`) and the window switched
  from `ResizeMode="NoResize"` + `SizeToContent="WidthAndHeight"` to `ResizeMode="CanResize"`
  with a base size of `1200x780` and a `820x560` floor. The whole UI now scales uniformly
  (the chessboard stays square; panels keep their proportions) and the window letterboxes
  when its aspect ratio differs from the design ratio.
  The code-behind shrank from 227 to ~107 lines: the monitor-fit board arithmetic, the
  `OnDpiChanged`/`LocationChanged` re-layout plumbing, and the `user32` P/Invoke
  (`MonitorFromWindow`/`GetMonitorInfo`) were removed in favour of a single one-time
  `ApplyDesignLayout` at a fixed `DesignBoardSize` (the Viewbox handles on-screen and DPI
  scaling). This also removed a latent crash: with `Content` now the `Viewbox`, the former
  `(Grid)Content` cast would have thrown.
- **`app.manifest`** — added an application manifest declaring Per-Monitor V2 DPI awareness
  (`dpiAwareness` = `PerMonitorV2, PerMonitor`, with the legacy `dpiAware` = `true/pm`
  fallback) and wired it via `<ApplicationManifest>` in `NQueen.GUI.csproj`. The window now
  re-renders crisply when dragged between monitors with different scale factors (e.g. 100%
  laptop to 150% external) instead of relying on WPF's System-aware default, which
  bitmap-stretches on the secondary monitor. Complements the `Viewbox` layout scaling, which
  is independent of DPI awareness.
- **Spacing system** — introduced a single source of truth for layout spacing on a 4px grid
  (`AppStyles.xaml` `Thickness` tokens: `PanelContentMargin` 8, `FramePadding` 4,
  `ButtonMargin` 8, `PanelStackGap` 0,8,0,0, `FieldRowMargin` 0,4, `LabelCellMargin` 0,4,8,4,
  `InputCellMargin` 0,4,0,4). The Input, Output, Simulation, Active-solution, Solver-settings
  and solutions-list panels now reference these tokens instead of ad-hoc literals
  (previously a mix of 2/3/5/6/8/10). The `MainWindow` right-hand control column was
  simplified from a 7-row layout with hard-coded 2px spacer rows to a 4-row stack using a
  consistent `PanelStackGap`.

### Fixed (NQueen.GUI)
- **`MainWindow.xaml` / `ActiveSolutionUserControl.xaml`** — clicking **Simulate** no longer
  appears to resize the window. A `Viewbox` measures its child at infinite size, so the root
  `Grid`'s content-driven natural size determined the uniform scale: when Simulate populated
  the "Selected Solution" locations text, the canvas grew and the whole UI zoomed (which
  looks identical to a resize, though the OS window bounds never changed). The Viewbox child
  now has a fixed design `Width="1240"`, and the header details `TextBlock` uses
  `TextWrapping="NoWrap"` so long location strings scroll horizontally inside the existing
  `ScrollViewer` instead of changing the canvas size. The scale is now constant regardless of
  content.
- **`MainWindow.xaml` / `ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — the three middle-row columns
  (solution list, chessboard, control panels) now align at the top, and the gaps on the left
  and right of the chessboard are equal. The chessboard `Border` carried a `Margin="2"` that
  pushed its top/sides 2px in relative to the neighbouring frames, and the right-hand control
  column carried an extra `Margin="8,0,0,0"` on top of the grid's 10px gap column (making the
  right gap ~8px wider than the left). Both stray offsets were removed; the grid's two 10px
  gap columns are now the sole source of horizontal spacing.

### Removed (NQueen.GUI)
- **`AppStyles.xaml`** — deleted the unused `GroupBoxStyle` (every `GroupBox` set its
  properties inline, so the style — including a stale `Margin="5,0,0,0"` — never applied).

### Performance (NQueen.Kernel)
- **`BitmaskSolver.CountUnique.cs`** — tightened the prefix-prune gate in the
  `CountCanonicalDFS` hot loop so `SearchHelpers.ShouldPrunePrefixFull` is only invoked when
  reflection pruning is enabled. The loop-invariant `reflectionEnabled` flag is now tested
  first (`reflectionEnabled && col >= pruneDepthGate && …`), short-circuiting the call
  entirely on the reflection-off path and making the gate self-documenting. Behaviour is
  unchanged when reflection pruning is on (the production/benchmark configuration), so the
  unique count-only path is provably identical — verified by the existing exact-count tests
  (e.g. N=16 = 1 846 955). Measured on an isolated N=16/N=17 CPU benchmark the change is
  within run-to-run noise (no regression; the hot path remains ~97 % self-CPU in
  `CountCanonicalDFS`), so this is adopted as a correctness-neutral, low-risk cleanup rather
  than a speedup.

### Added (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **`UniqueFastHalfBoardEvenOddBenchmark`** — isolated CPU benchmark pinned to N=16 (even)
  and N=17 (odd) that drives the Unique count-only `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard` →
  `CountCanonicalDFS` hot path directly. Added because the existing
  `UniqueFastHalfBoardBenchmark` `[Params(15, 16, 17)]` case aborts on N=15 (which routes
  through the separate `BitmaskParallelEngine.RunUnique` path, not the half-board DFS),
  producing `NA` and no usable baseline. This harness is the reusable measurement artifact
  for future kernel hot-loop work on this path.

### Fixed (NQueen.ViewModelTests)
- **`ProgressRelayTests.Heartbeat_ShouldSyntheticAdvance_WhenNoRealProgress`** — replaced a
  fixed `await Task.Delay(150)` with `TestHelpers.WaitForConditionAsync(() => vm.IsSimulating, …)`.
  The hard-coded delay raced with the async `SimulateCommand` start on slow CI runners,
  intermittently asserting `IsSimulating == true` before the simulation had begun
  (observed failing the PR gate while passing locally). Polling the actual condition makes
  the test deterministic.

### Added (Tooling)
- **`Fast.runsettings`** — opt-in test run settings that exclude the
  `[Trait("Category", "Slow")]` enumeration tests (N=13–15 full counts), letting the
  fast suite (~390 tests) run in a few seconds locally. Select it via *Test → Configure
  Run Settings* in Visual Studio or `dotnet test --settings Fast.runsettings`. Does not
  affect CI or unfiltered runs. README updated with usage.

### Fixed (CI)
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — split CI into two jobs so pull requests are no longer
  blocked by slow coverage instrumentation. Coverlet's line instrumentation over the
  recursive solver hot paths inflated an ~8s test suite to ~45 min on the 2-core runner,
  so PR checks were timing out in practice. Now a fast **`build-test`** gate builds and
  runs the non-Slow tests **without coverage** (PRs go green in a couple of minutes, with a
  `timeout-minutes: 15` safety net), while a separate, non-blocking **`coverage`** job
  (runs only on push to `main` or manual `workflow_dispatch`, `continue-on-error: true`)
  produces the Cobertura + HTML report and uploads the artifact.
- Earlier fix retained: the coverage step uses the `coverlet.collector` driver
  (`--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` + cobertura via `DataCollectionRunSettings`) instead
  of the unsupported coverlet.msbuild `/p:` flags, so `coverage.cobertura.xml` is actually
  produced and ReportGenerator finds it.

### Fixed (NQueen.GUI)
- **`MainWindow.xaml`** — changed `SizeToContent` from `Width` to `WidthAndHeight` and
  the main content `RowDefinition` from `Height="*"` to `Height="Auto"` so WPF measures
  the full content height at startup; bottom panels (Simulation, Solver Settings) are no
  longer clipped regardless of board size or display mode. Removed the interim `MinHeight`
  workaround.
- **`ListOfSolutionsUserControl.xaml`** — added `MaxHeight="130"` to the `ListBox` to
  cap the solution list at ~5 visible items (scrollbar appears when needed); corrected
  `Border` and inner `Grid` from `VerticalAlignment="Stretch"` to `VerticalAlignment="Top"`
  so the list stays top-aligned after the layout change.

### Refactored (NQueen.Kernel)
- **`BitmaskSolver.cs`** — split two cohesive method groups out into new partial-class files,
  reducing the file from 710 lines to 268 lines:
  - **`BitmaskSolver.CountUnique.cs`** — `CountUniqueAdaptive` and `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard`;
    the two unique count-only algorithms now live together in one focused file.
  - **`BitmaskSolver.Materialize.cs`** — `SampleMaterializeUsingLookup`,
    `ConstructiveSampleSolutions`, `GenerateConstructiveSolution`, `GenerateSymmetryVariants`;
    all sample-materialisation helpers grouped in one place.
  - `BitmaskSolver.cs` retains constructors, public API, `Solve`, `HandleModeCommon`,
    private fields, `ResetForSolve`, `BuildResults`, `ValidateRows`, `Dispose`, `EnsureMinThreads`.
  No behaviour changes; 430/430 tests pass.

### Added (NQueen.ViewModelTests)
- **`MainViewModelPositiveTests.cs`** — added `SaveSimulationResultsCommand_ShouldWriteContentViaService`:
  verifies that executing `SaveCommand` with a ready view-model invokes `ISaveFileDialogService`,
  writes non-empty content, and includes the board size and solution mode in the saved text.
  Uses the existing `MockSaveFileDialogService`; closes the long-standing TODO comment.

### Added (NQueen.UnitTests)
- **`BitmaskSolverCountUniqueTests.cs`** — 14 fast tests targeting the previously
  thinly-covered `BitmaskSolver.CountUnique.cs` (15 % line / 3 % branch baseline).
  Drives `CountUniqueAdaptive` through the public `ISolverBackEnd.GetSimResultsAsync`
  API with `SolutionMode.Unique` + count-only storage, covering the
  `BitmaskParallelEngine.RunUnique` branch (N = 1..9), the `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard`
  branch (N = 16, pruning-flag preservation), the save/restore semantics for
  `EnablePrefixMinimalityPruning` and `EnablePartialReflectionPruning`, and the
  `UniqueStorageMode = CountOnly` path. Full class runs in ~1.1 s.
- **`BitmaskSolverSingleModeTests.cs`** — 17 fast tests targeting
  `BitmaskSolver.Single.cs` (41 % line / 25 % branch baseline). Covers each routing
  branch in `SolveSingleMode`: curated fast path (N = 1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13),
  empty-curated fall-through to fallback enumeration (N = 2, 3 — no solution),
  fallback enumeration for small N below `LargeBoardIntermediateStartSize`
  (N = 14), constructive path for N ≥ `LargeBoardIntermediateStartSize`
  (N = 15, 16, 17), engine-backed visualize branch with events, in-flight
  cancellation via the `IsSolverCanceled` flag, packed-storage materialisation
  (N ≤ 25), solver-state reset across consecutive runs, and the `enableCap=false`
  constructor overload. Full class runs in ~0.6 s.
- **`BitmaskSolverAllModeTests.cs`** — 17 fast tests (12 declarations + 5 Theory
  expansions) targeting `BitmaskSolver.All.cs`. Drives `RunAllUnified`,
  `EnumerateAllAdaptive`, `CollectAllSamplesAndCountParallel`, and
  `CollectAllSampleSolutionsDFS` through the public `ISolverBackEnd.GetSimResultsAsync`
  API, covering each routing branch: count-only small-N path through
  `BitboardNQueenSolver.CountSolutions` (N = 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; plus zero-solution
  N = 2, 3), small-N materialize path through `RunAllUnified` (N = 8),
  two-phase materialize path through `CollectAllSamplesAndCountParallel` at
  `N = ParallelAllMaterializeAutoEnableThresholdN` (= 14), count-only at N = 14,
  `CollectAllSampleSolutionsDFS` cap-stop semantics, event emission with post-cap
  suppression, in-flight cancellation via the `IsSolverCanceled` flag,
  `AllStorageMode = CountOnly` equivalence with `UseCountOnlyAllMode`,
  solver-state reset across consecutive runs, and the `enableCap=false`
  constructor overload. Full class runs in ~0.75 s.
- **`BitmaskSolverUniqueTests.cs`** — 15 fast tests (11 declarations + 4 Theory
  expansions) targeting the materialize path of `BitmaskSolver.Unique.cs`. Drives
  `ExecuteUniqueModeUnified` and `EnumerateUniqueVisualizeAdaptive` through the
  public `ISolverBackEnd.GetSimResultsAsync` API, covering each routing branch:
  small-N branch (N = 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 — `BitmaskSearchEngine.Run` with
  `RestrictFirstCol: true` and `IsIdentityCanonical` filter), zero-solution
  N = 2, 3, mid-N branch at `N = LargeBoardSymmetryPruningThreshold` (= 15) routing
  through `Engines.SymmetryPrunedUniqueCounter.Count`, large-N two-phase branch at
  `N = UniqueCountOnlyParallelThresholdN` (= 16) using `CollectUniqueSamplesDFS`
  + `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard` (asserting the exact OEIS A002562 count of
  1 846 955), `CollectUniqueSamplesDFS` cap-stop semantics,
  visualize-path event emission, in-flight cancellation, solver-state reset
  across consecutive runs, and the `enableCap=false` constructor overload. Full
  class runs in ~1.6 s. Count-only Unique routing remains covered by
  `BitmaskSolverCountUniqueTests`.
- **`SearchHelpersTests.cs`** — 5 new tests for the stateless reflection-only
  `SearchHelpers.ShouldPrunePrefixFull` helper: reflection-disabled no-op,
  prune-when-reflection-smaller, no-prune-when-identity-wins, negative-row guard,
  and an explicit regression guard asserting the helper does **not** apply the
  unsound rotate-180 minimality prune that caused the N >= 16 under-count.
- **`BitmaskSolverMaterializeTests.cs`** — 7 fast tests (10 with Theory expansions)
  targeting `BitmaskSolver.Materialize.cs`, the last `BitmaskSolver.*.cs` partial
  without a dedicated class. Drives `SampleMaterializeUsingLookup`,
  `ConstructiveSampleSolutions`, `GenerateConstructiveSolution`, and
  `GenerateSymmetryVariants` through the public `ISolverBackEnd.GetSimResultsAsync`
  API at `N >= LookupThresholdN` (21), where the count is served from the lookup
  table and samples are built constructively (no DFS). Covers both constructive
  special-case branches — N = 21 (`n % 6 == 3`) and N = 26 (`n % 6 == 2`) — in All
  and Unique modes, asserting the curated count and that every materialised sample
  is a conflict-free placement; the display cap (default and explicit) is honoured;
  Unique-mode samples are distinct (raw `int[]` storage exercises
  `GenerateSymmetryVariants`); and solver state resets across consecutive runs.

### Fixed (NQueen.Kernel — invalid constructive placement for n % 6 ∈ {2, 3})
- **`BitmaskSolver.Materialize.cs`** — rewrote `GenerateConstructiveSolution` to the
  canonical closed-form explicit construction keyed on `n mod 6`. The previous
  `n % 6 == 2` and `n % 6 == 3` special-case branches both emitted placements with a
  diagonal conflict (e.g. N = 15 and N = 20 placed two queens on a shared
  anti-diagonal). Because `ValidateRows` only checks row-array length — not diagonal
  legality — the invalid boards were surfaced silently through the constructive
  Single-mode path (N = 15, 21, 27) and the lookup-materialize sample path
  (N = 21, 26, 27). The corrected algorithm lists the even rows then the odd rows,
  moving `2` to the end of the evens and `1, 3` to the end of the odds for
  `n % 6 == 3`, and swapping `1`/`3` then moving `5` to the end of the odds for
  `n % 6 == 2`; output for every other remainder is unchanged ("evens then odds").
  Verified conflict-free for N = 8, 9, 14, 15, 20 and through the public API by the
  now-strict `SingleMode_ConstructivePath_ReturnsValidSolutionWithoutEnumeration`
  (N = 15, 16, 17) and the new `BitmaskSolverMaterializeTests` (N = 21, 26).

### Fixed (NQueen.Kernel — Unique mode count under-report at N >= 16)
- **`BitmaskSolver.CountUnique.cs` / `Engines/SearchHelpers.cs`** — corrected a
  silent under-count in `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard` that returned 692 857 instead
  of the OEIS A002562 value of 1 846 955 for N = 16 (and was wrong for N = 17..20).
  Root cause: the shared forward-prefix prune applied a rotate-180 "minimality"
  test that compares `rows[i]` against `N-1-rows[depth-i]` — i.e. against columns
  not yet fixed at the current depth — which is unsound as a forward-prefix prune
  and discarded branches that still extend to valid canonical solutions. The
  defect was previously invisible because the only other consumer
  (`SymmetryPrunedUniqueCounter`) runs with an effectively disabled prune gate at
  its sole reachable size (N = 15), and no N >= 16 test asserted the exact count.
  Fix: `SearchHelpers.ShouldPrunePrefixFull` is now reflection-only (horizontal
  reflection is the only sound forward-prefix prune; full canonicality across all
  eight symmetries is still enforced exactly by `IsIdentityCanonical` at the leaf).
  Both consumers were updated and the dead minimality parameter removed. Verified
  by the now-exact `UniqueMode_Materialize_N16_RoutesThroughTwoPhasePath`
  assertion and new `SearchHelpersTests` coverage.

### Performance (NQueen.Kernel — Unique count-only depth-2 parallelisation)
- **`BitmaskSolver.CountUnique.cs`** — replaced the coarse root-row partitioning in
  `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard` (which produced only ~(N+1)/2 uneven `Partitioner` ranges,
  ≈ 8–10 work items, leaving cores idle on tail imbalance) with **depth-2 work items**:
  one item per valid (column-0, column-1) queen pair, with column 0 restricted to the
  top half. For N = 20 this yields ~180 fine-grained items instead of ~10, giving far
  better core saturation and load-balancing. The former closure DFS is extracted to a
  reusable `CountCanonicalDFS` method driven by `Parallel.ForEach` with
  `localInit`/`localFinally` per-thread `rows`/`scratch` buffers (rented from
  `ArrayPool<int>`). The visited leaf set and the `IsIdentityCanonical` leaf filter are
  unchanged, so the canonical count is provably identical — verified by the exact-count
  tests at N = 16/17/18 (1 846 955 / 11 977 939 / 83 263 591). Measured wall-clock on a
  multi-core dev box: N = 16 446 → 271 ms (1.65×), N = 17 3058 → 2152 ms (1.42×),
  N = 18 20 983 → 13 725 ms (1.53×). Addresses the "CPU utilisation drop at N = 19
  Unique CountOnly" tail-imbalance investigation in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

### Docs
- **`README.md`** — replaced the single-line placeholder with a full README covering:
  features, algorithm overview, project structure, prerequisites, build & run instructions
  (Console interactive + non-interactive flag reference, WPF GUI), solver options table,
  known solution counts (OEIS A000170 / A002562), benchmark results, contributing guide,
  and licence.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — new persistent roadmap document. Records current project
  state (release, branch, test count, coverage snapshot), the active kernel
  test-coverage track (per `BitmaskSolver.*.cs` partial), and the consolidated
  backlog (kernel performance items from `Code Analysis - 02-02.2026.txt` and
  `Potential All Mode Improvements.txt`, four known GUI issues, and the N = 15
  `n % 6 == 3` constructive-placement defect surfaced by
  `BitmaskSolverSingleModeTests`). Includes a workflow rule that ties roadmap
  updates to `CHANGELOG.md` entries so the two documents stay in sync.
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — added a `### Roadmap` section pointing
  every new Copilot session at `docs/ROADMAP.md` so the roadmap is auto-loaded as
  context. Also updated the partial-file list under `### Solver Conventions` to
  include the two newly extracted partials (`BitmaskSolver.CountUnique.cs`,
  `BitmaskSolver.Materialize.cs`).

### Fixed (NQueen.Kernel — Unique Visualize path)
- **`BitmaskSolver.Unique.cs`** — `EnumerateUniqueVisualizeAdaptive` was visiting ~2×
  more nodes than necessary: a single full-board pass was used for both GUI animation
  and solution counting. Replaced with a two-phase approach matching the established
  `CollectAllSamplesAndCountParallel` pattern in All mode:
  - **Phase 1** — full-board animation DFS (`RestrictFirstCol: false`) so the GUI
    shows queens placed on any row in column 0; stops as soon as `cap` canonical
    samples are stored. Uses `IsIdentityCanonical` filter instead of the previous
    `HashSet<UInt128>` dedup, eliminating per-solution hash allocations.
  - **Phase 2** — `CountUniqueAdaptive` for the exact solution count via the
    half-board algorithm (~2× fewer nodes than the old full-board pass).
  Solution counts are unchanged; verified across N = 8–16.

### Performance (NQueen.Kernel)
- **`BitmaskSearchEngine.cs`** — replaced 18-line De Bruijn 64-bit lookup table with
  `BitOperations.TrailingZeroCount` JIT intrinsic (`TZCNT` on x64), eliminating a
  multiply + shift + array-index on every queen-placement candidate in the hot DFS loop.
  Also removes the 64-byte static `_deBruijnIndex64` array from the type's static state.
- **`BitmaskSearchEngine.cs`** — converted `SearchState` from `sealed class` to `struct`.
  All call sites already passed it via `ref`; the change eliminates one heap allocation
  per `Run()` call and improves cache locality of the DFS state machine fields.
- **`BitmaskSolver.cs`** — introduced `EnsureMinThreads()` with an `Interlocked`
  one-shot guard. `ThreadPool.SetMinThreads` was previously called on every large-board
  parallel solve (a permanent process-wide write); it now executes at most once per
  process lifetime.

### Fixed (NQueen.Kernel)
- **`BitmaskSolver.cs`** — removed redundant outer `lock (_sync)` in `GetSimResultsAsync`;
  `Solve()` already acquires the same lock, making the outer acquire a no-op reentrant
  acquisition.
- **`BitmaskSolver.cs`** — replaced `_scratchBuffer ?? new int[rows.Length * 8]` in
  `ConstructiveSampleSolutions` with `_scratchBuffer!`; the buffer is guaranteed non-null
  after `ResetForSolve()`, so the fallback allocation was unnecessary.

### Refactored (NQueen.Kernel)
- **`Usings.cs`** — removed `global using System;`, `global using System.Collections.Generic;`,
  and `global using System.Threading.Tasks;`; all three are already injected by
  `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`.

---

### Added (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **`ConsolePruningImpactBenchmarks.cs`** — two new benchmark classes
  (`ConsolePruningImpactAllBenchmark`, `ConsolePruningImpactUniqueBenchmark`) that measure
  the performance difference between the old Console solver configuration (no pruning,
  events on) and the new one (pruning on, events off, adaptive depth) across N = 12, 14, 16.
  Measured results on Intel i7-14700K / .NET 10.0.8 (5 iterations, 2 warmup):
  - Unique N=12: **−12%** (836 µs vs 955 µs)
  - Unique N=14: **−7%** (12.9 ms vs 13.8 ms)
  - Unique N=16: flat (220 ms vs 226 ms, +2.4% within error — both configs take the
    same `CountUniqueFastHalfBoard` path; `CountUniqueAdaptive` forces pruning flags on
    regardless of input settings, so `UseAdaptiveDepth` and external flag values are
    irrelevant here; observed spread is thermal/TurboBoost variance)
  - All N=12: flat (355 µs vs 360 µs)
  - All N=14: flat (4.66 ms vs 4.72 ms)
  - All N=16: flat (197 ms vs 188 ms, within noise)
- **`Program.cs`** — default run updated to `ConsolePruningImpactAllBenchmark` +
  `ConsolePruningImpactUniqueBenchmark`.

### Fixed (NQueen.Console)
- **`DispatchCommands.cs`** — interactive solver branches now set `EnableEvents = false`
  (eliminates wasted event firing with no subscribers), `IsSolverCanceled = false` (prevents
  stale cancellation state on repeated runs), `EnablePrefixMinimalityPruning = true`,
  `EnablePartialReflectionPruning = true`, and `UseAdaptiveDepth = boardSize >= 14` —
  matching the GUI's kernel configuration for equivalent performance.
  Also switched bare `var solver` to `using var solver` to fix a resource leak.
- **`DispatchCommands.cs`** — All-mode interactive path now sets
  `EnableHalfBoardRestriction = boardSize >= 15`, consistent with the non-interactive path
  and the GUI.
- **`Program.cs`** — non-interactive solver block extended with `IsSolverCanceled = false`,
  `EnablePrefixMinimalityPruning = true`, `EnablePartialReflectionPruning = true`, and
  `UseAdaptiveDepth = size >= 14` to match the GUI's optimisation settings.

### Refactored (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **File consolidation** — reduced 14 benchmark source files to 7 thematic files for
  improved readability and SRP compliance:
  - `SymmetryBenchmarks.cs` — merges `SymmetryHelperCanonicalFormBenchmark`,
    `SymmetryHelperCanonicalKeyBenchmark`, `SymmetryPackedBenchmarks`,
    `SymmetryPrunedUniqueCounterBenchmark` (4 old files → 1).
  - `UniqueModeBenchmarks.cs` — merges `UniqueSolutionCounterPackedBenchmark`,
    `CountUniqueFastHalfBoardBenchmark`, `CountUniqueHalfBoardBenchmarks`,
    `UniqueCountOnlyHighNBenchmark` (4 old files → 1).
  - `AllModeBenchmarks.cs` — merges `AllCountOnlyN18Benchmark`,
    `CombinedSolverBenchmarks` (All-mode half), `MediumPrefixPruningParallelBenchmark`
    (3 old files → 1); `AllPrefixPruningBenchmark` replaces
    `MediumPrefixPruningParallelBenchmark` with cleaner parameterised design.
  - `UniqueModeVariantsBenchmark.cs` — carries the Unique-mode half of
    `CombinedSolverBenchmarks` as a standalone file.
- **11 style/correctness issues resolved** across all benchmark files:
  - Fixed 3 misaligned closing braces (`SymmetryPackedBenchmarks.cs`,
    `CountUniqueHalfBoardBenchmarks.cs`, `UniqueCountOnlyHighNBenchmark.cs`).
  - Fixed `BitmaskSolver` resource leak in `SymmetryAddIfUniquePackedBenchmark`
    (`GlobalSetup` now uses `using var solver`).
  - Extracted `NoopFormatter` and replaced 12 `new SolutionFormatter()` instances in
    count-only benchmarks.
  - Removed all `SetSimulationToken` calls (redundant when `EnableEvents = false`).
  - Converted constructor-style solver init to object-initialiser style throughout.
  - Replaced `new int[…]` scratch allocations with `GetScratchBufferSize()`.
  - Changed `private int[] field = null!;` declarations to auto-properties.
  - Renamed `N` → `BoardSize` in `NQueenBench` for naming consistency.
  - Removed redundant `global using System` and `global using System.Linq` from
    `Usings.cs` (covered by `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`).
- **`Program.cs`** — updated default `BenchmarkRunner.Run<>` reference from removed
  `UniqueCountOnlyHighNBenchmark` to consolidated `UniqueHighNBenchmark`.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-29  _(branch `refactor/consolidate` merged to `main`)_

### Fixed (NQueen.Console)
- **`Program.cs`** — `--halfboard` CLI flag no longer silently does nothing when `--mode`
  is not `all`. A yellow warning is now printed and the flag is cleared before the solver
  runs, making the ignored intent explicit to the user.

### Added (NQueen.Kernel — XML documentation)
- **`BitmaskSolver.cs`** — added `<summary>` XML doc comments to all 11 previously
  undocumented public configuration properties:
  `EnableEvents`, `AllStorageMode`, `UniqueStorageMode`, `UseCountOnlyUniqueMode`,
  `UseCountOnlyAllMode`, `UseParallel`, `ParallelRootSplitDepth`, `UseAdaptiveDepth`,
  `EnablePrefixMinimalityPruning`, `EnablePartialReflectionPruning`,
  `EnableHalfBoardRestriction`.
  Each comment describes the property's effect, default value, and any interactions with
  related properties or mode constraints.

### Fixed (CI)
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — rewrote the existing workflow to fix several bugs and
  improve reliability:
  - Added missing `: ` separators in `env:` values (`DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` and
    `DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` were silently ignored before).
  - Removed `dotnet-quality: 'preview'` — .NET 10 is GA; the flag caused unnecessary
    pre-release SDK resolution.
  - Added explicit `dotnet build --configuration Release` step before test so
    `--no-build` in the test step is valid and faster.
  - Added `--no-build` and `--configuration Release` to `dotnet test`.
  - Excluded `NQueen.Benchmarking` from coverage collection (it is an exe, not a test
    assembly, and caused the test runner to fail trying to discover tests in it).
  - Extended `push` branch triggers to also cover `refactor/**`, `feature/**`, `fix/**`
    so CI runs on all active development branches, not just `main`.
  - Added `pull_request: branches: [main]` filter so PRs into other branches do not
    trigger unnecessary runs.
  - Added `retention-days: 14` to the coverage artifact upload.
  - Renamed workflow from `ci` to `CI` for display clarity.

### Fixed (project configuration)
- **`NQueen.ConsoleApp.csproj`** — changed `TargetFramework` from `net10.0-windows` to
  `net10.0`; the Console project has no Windows-specific dependencies (no WPF, no WinForms,
  no P/Invoke), so the `-windows` suffix was unnecessary and restricted portability.

### Removed (NQueen.Benchmarking dead template artefacts)
- **`Properties\Resources.resx`** and **`Properties\Resources.Designer.cs`** — deleted;
  these were left over from the project template and are never referenced by any benchmark.
- **`NQueen.Benchmarking.csproj`** — removed the dead `<EmbeddedResource>` entry that
  pointed to the now-deleted `Resources.resx`.

### Removed (NQueen.Benchmarking dead code)
- **`Usings.cs`** — removed dead `global using NQueen.Kernel;`; the root namespace has no
  public types after `BitboardNQueenSolver` moved to `NQueen.Kernel.Solvers`.
- **`AllCountOnlyN18Benchmark.cs`**, **`CountUniqueFastHalfBoardBenchmark.cs`**,
  **`CountUniqueHalfBoardBenchmarks.cs`** — removed three identical copy-pasted private
  `NoopFormatter` nested classes, replaced by a single shared top-level class.

### Added (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **`NoopFormatter.cs`** — new shared `internal sealed class NoopFormatter` consolidating
  the three previously duplicated nested formatters.
- **`NQueenBench.cs`** — extracted `NQueenBench` benchmark class out of `Program.cs` into
  its own file; each benchmark class now lives in its own file.

### Fixed (NQueen.Benchmarking)
- **`Program.cs`** — removed `NQueenBench` class (moved to `NQueenBench.cs`); fixed
  corrupted `…` ellipsis character in the startup console message.
- **`UniqueSolutionCounterPackedBenchmark.cs`** — added `using var` to `BitmaskSolver`
  for consistent deterministic disposal, matching every other benchmark.
- **`SymmetryHelperCanonicalKeyBenchmark.cs`** — changed `int[]?` fields to `int[] = null!`
  and removed the unreachable null-guard inside `[Benchmark]` (`[GlobalSetup]` always runs
  before `[Benchmark]` in BenchmarkDotNet).
- **`CombinedSolverBenchmarks.cs`** — reduced `AllModeVariantsBenchmark` parameter space
  from 144 combinations (3×3×2×2×4) to 32 (2×2×2×4) by collapsing the two independent
  pruning booleans into a single `EnablePruning` flag and trimming the size/depth ranges to
  the two most representative values each.

### Removed (NQueen.Console dead code)
- **`CommandConstants.cs`** — entire file deleted; every constant was only referenced from
  `CommandProcessor` or `HelpCommands`, both of which are also removed.
- **`ConsoleUtils.cs`** — entire file deleted; `WriteLineColored` was only called from
  the dead `HelpCommands` class.
- **`HelpCommands.cs`** — entire file deleted; all members (`ShowHelp`, `ShowExitError`,
  `DumpAllHelp`, `DumpHelpText`, `Valid_Commands`, `Command_Example`, `NQueen_Help_Board_Size`,
  `NQueen_Solution_Mode`, `NQUEEN_BOARDSIZE`, `Bitmask_Help`, `Banner`) had zero live call sites.
- **`ICommandProcessor.cs`** — interface deleted; never resolved from DI at runtime.
- **`CommandProcessor.cs`** — class deleted; all three methods were deprecation-message stubs
  with no live callers.
- **`DispatchUtils.cs`** — entire file deleted; `ParseInput`, `CreateChessBoard`, and
  `LaunchConsoleMonitor` all had zero call sites.
- **`DispatchCommands`** — removed dead `RegexSpaces()`, `genRegEx()`, and `_whiteSpacesRegex`;
  `partial` modifier removed now that no source-generated partial members remain.
- **`App.cs`** — removed dead `DispatchCommands dispatchCommands` constructor parameter and the
  `_dispatchCommands` field; `RunInteractiveMenu` is `static` so the instance was never used.
- **`Program.cs`** — removed stale dotnet-counters installation comment and dead DI
  registrations for `DispatchCommands` (transient) and `ICommandProcessor`/`CommandProcessor`.
- **`Using.cs`** — removed three dead global usings: `NQueen.ConsoleApp.Interfaces`,
  `System.Diagnostics`, `System.Text.RegularExpressions`.

### Renamed
- **`DispachCommands.cs` → `DispatchCommands.cs`** — corrected long-standing filename typo
  (missing `t`). Class name was already correct; only the filename was misspelled.

### Fixed (accessibility)
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — added `AutomationProperties.Name="Chessboard"` to the
  outer `Border` to satisfy the *NameNotNull* rule (Accessibility Checker error at line 16).
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml`** — bound `Width` and `Height` from `SquareViewModel` and
  added `AutomationProperties.Name="{Binding}"` to each DataTemplate `Border`, giving every
  chess square a concrete bounding rectangle and resolving the *BoundingRectangleNotNull* rule
  (Accessibility Checker error at line 36).
- **`ChessboardUserControl.xaml.cs`** — removed the now-resolved TODO comment block that
  tracked both accessibility errors.

### Removed (dead code)
- **`SimulationSettings`** — deleted 7 unused members:
  `ParallelAllAutoEnableThresholdN`, `LargeBoardProgressThrottleThreshold`,
  `DynamicRootSplitLimitN`, `AdaptiveRootMultiplier`, `RootBranchThreshold`,
  `WeightLookaheadDepth`, `CalculateSplitDepth`.
- **`BoardSettings`** — deleted 6 unused constants:
  `RelativeFactor`, `ExtraSmallSizeForUniqueMode`, `SmallSizeForUniqueMode`,
  `MediumSizeForUniqueMode`, `RelativeLargeSizeForUniqueMode`, `DefaultQueenImagePath`.
- **`MainViewModel.Properties.cs`** — removed unreachable private method `UpdateProgress(double, string)`.
- **`MainViewModel.Properties.cs`** — removed no-op `OnIsSingleRunningChanged` partial callback
  (the CommunityToolkit source generator already fires `PropertyChanged` automatically).
- **`LazyPositionList.cs`** — removed stale TODO comment; the class is already in use.
- **`HelpCommands.cs`** — removed dead `ProcessHelpCommand` method (zero call sites) and its
  two associated TODO comments; also removed orphaned `case` blocks left by the method removal.
- **`DispatchUtils.cs`** — removed two stale TODO comments (`"Change the order of indices"` and
  `"Find a better data structu"`) — the board rendering and variable naming are both correct.
- **`InputViewModel.cs`** — removed stale bug TODO; the described chessboard-reset issue is
  already resolved by `UpdateUiState()` calling `ChessboardVm?.CreateSquares(boardSize)` before
  every simulation.
- **`UiMessages.cs`** — removed stale TODO to move constants; the referenced constants are
  already present in `CommandConst`.

### Clarified
- **`ISolverBackEnd`** — replaced stale "moved from ISolver" inline comment with a clear
  description of `UseCountOnlyAllMode`/`UseCountOnlyUniqueMode` and their relationship to
  the solver's `ResultStorageMode` properties.

### Refactored
- **`BitboardNQueenSolver` relocated** — moved from `NQueen.Kernel/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel`) to `NQueen.Kernel/Solvers/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel.Solvers`), co-locating it with `BitmaskSolver` and all other
  solver infrastructure. No call-site changes required; the existing
  `global using NQueen.Kernel.Solvers;` in `NQueen.Kernel/Usings.cs` already covers all callers.
- **`ISolverFrontEnd` TODO removed** — deleted the stale five-line TODO comment block from
  `NQueen.Domain/Interfaces/ISolverFrontEnd.cs`. The described work (migrate event-arg types
  to `Memory<int>` and add a `Guid`-bearing progress event) had already been fully implemented
  in `QueenPlacedEventArgs`, `SolutionFoundEventArgs`, and `ProgressUpdateEventArgs`.

### Verified
- Build: ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: ✅ 304/304 passing
