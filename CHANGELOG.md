## [Unreleased] — branch `refactor/consolidate`

### Refactored
- **`BitboardNQueenSolver` relocated** — moved from `NQueen.Kernel/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel`) to `NQueen.Kernel/Solvers/BitboardNQueenSolver.cs`
  (namespace `NQueen.Kernel.Solvers`), co-locating it with `BitmaskSolver` and all other
  solver infrastructure. No call-site changes required; the existing
  `global using NQueen.Kernel.Solvers;` in `NQueen.Kernel/Usings.cs` already covers all callers.

- **`ISolverFrontEnd` TODO removed** — deleted the stale five-line TODO comment block from
  `NQueen.Domain/Interfaces/ISolverFrontEnd.cs`. The described work (migrate event-arg types
  to `Memory<int>` and add a `Guid`-bearing progress event) had already been fully implemented
  in `QueenPlacedEventArgs`, `SolutionFoundEventArgs`, and `ProgressUpdateEventArgs`.

### Verified
- Build: ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: ✅ 304/304 passing
